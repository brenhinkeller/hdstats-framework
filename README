README:
This is the README for HW1 of APC 524 by Stephen McDonald.
The code contains the 5 requested files:

euler.c
rk4.c
ab2.c
duffing.c
Makefile

The first three files are integrators for an ODE using the
Euler, 4th Order Runge-Kutta, and 2nd order Adams-Bashford 
methods respectively. All of them require the interface
integrator.h. They implement the interface using exactly
the functions as they are declared in integrator.h, thus
from the perspective of the user knowing the interface
is all that is required, the internal workings of the 
integrators do not matter. 

duffing.c is the driver program. 
It contains a function which calculates the values of the 
two-dimensional system of 1st-order ODEs for the forced duffing
oscillator. It implements the functions as declared in
integrator.h, thus the integration method implemented is
dependent on which integrator file defining those functions
is compiled alongside duffing.c. 

The Makefile contains the commands that generates the targets
duffing_euler, duffing_rk4, and duffing_ab2. Once the included
files, as well as integrator.h have been added to the 
working directory, entering the command make will generate
the targets. The compiled euler, runge-kutta, adams-bashford,
integrators of the forced duffing oscillator can be run using
./duffing_euler timeStep numberStep
./duffing_rk4 timeStep numberStep
./duffing_ab2 timeStep numberStep
respectively, where timeStep is a double listing the timeStep
to be used, and numberStep is an integer listing the number
of steps to take. 

For all three methods, the programs output 3 columns, where
the first contains the time, the second contains x, and the 
third contains y (the first derivative of x).
